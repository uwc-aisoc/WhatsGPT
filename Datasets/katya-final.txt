I’ll check if I can come, but I’ll only finish at 6:30
Is it okay if I come late?
Idk if that would be weird because I don’t know them super well
So it won’t be awkward??
Because I know them I’m just not really close but it sounds really fun
I think I can go but I have to double check
Thanks for inviting me though :)))
Sure! If not don’t worry about it
I don’t think I have any of their numbers though
Yeah haha
Ummm
I don’t really know the Ariane or garance very well…
Idk why it typed the haha
Nah he doesn’t like me :(((
It’s so sad
But whatever
Are other people who don’t really know them going though?
Because if not then I get if it’s like a private thing
Especially because they’re leaving
I mean it would be okay but I would only be able to reach by like 7:30…
Yeah
I have a swim meet at 5 that’s why
Ohh ok
Haha no problem
You too :)
Well if there are any parties that aren’t for people leaving let me know haha
Very
Marcus is not a requirement
Thanks
I appreciate that I come off as non-annoying and unclingy
:)))
Because I swear I never get invited to parties and it’s kinda sad
I think it’s because everyone assumes that I need 8 hours of sleep before swimming and won’t skip it
I’ll get 2 hours and still go
I feel marginally better about myself now haha
If we’re being completely honest I’ve literally never been invited to a party
The closest thing was a sleepover with like 5 people where we went to a gas station at 2 in the morning
It’s at least a 15
We got Doritos and ice cream
It was honestly so fun
2 AM DORITOS AND ICE CRWAM
I KNOWWWWW
HAJEOEJDIEM
Oh yeah haha
I did it to annoy my friend
If it helps I can’t see if you’ve read my messages either
Oops my dad’s calling me for dinner
Byeee
Ooh it looks like fun, how is it?
This message was deleted
Vanessa’s bracelet is so cute
Haha I would be doing the same lol
Hey, I think we have to finish the tax comparison doc by tomorrow- I can try and do Canada, Kenya, and Denmark
Ugh i was trying to find the tax brackets for Canada and they’re so unnecessarily confusing
Maybe I’m just dumb
Sure :)
If I can’t understand it I can’t pay it
Wow I feel understood now
Honestly that’s kind of interesting
I’ll check, thanks for telling me
Of course it was
I thought it was actually hilarious
Sara and I were laughing about it in maths
NO ACTIALLY
This is why I had to leave
My humour is beyond them
Maybe haha
Thabjs I thought you’d be proud of me
Tell them that next time, they should be less stupid
eg, understand my _joke_
And that would ruin it
It was a xrhostmad font
Heistmss
No
Christmas
Got it
Funny, Christopher
Hey, can we study together for econs? Youre really good at it would be really helpful
Ok but every time you’ve explained shit to me it just makes sense
Idk why and idk how but it does
Ok haha
Hii is it possible for you to take notes for me in econs please? I’m not going to be in school tomorrow because I’m racing
Thank youu :))
It’s ok I believe in you 💪💪
Umm
Wait good question actually
Maybe just take a pic and send it?
Thank you so much you’re such a lifesaver 🛟
HOW DO YOU DO THAT
ALSO ITS OK I CAN READ THAT
Hanyu just straight up texted me no
Please please please
Ugh fine I’ll ask Elisabeth
This is so passive aggressive
I take this back
You’re a death unsaver
Oh god how long did that take
Kinda impressive ngl
Where the fuck are the tomestams
OHH
I’m stupid
Don’t agree with that
Time stamps you know what I mean
Love the glasses on the stick figure tomatohead 🔥🔥🥫
You don’t deserve real tomatoes
Only canned ones
I hate you for this
Honestly I hate myself for starting this conversation you’d think I would know better by now
No
You’re kidding
You’ve got to be fucking kidding me
Is it cause he’s mad??
Ugh I need to have a word with this man
Talented
Noo i thought you left me sorryyy 😭😭
Fair
I’m not mad I understand the urgency
Oopsies just saw this it’s ok past chris you found the place I think
Either that or you just bought an obscene amount of croissants
You know I’ve just realised something
Whenever I study econs I feel like I’m right back in October 1929
Sorry sorry I’m going now but you better laugh or I’m gonna be mad
Do you get it do you get it do you get it
I’m not gonna laugh
Or else your ego might get too big
Or inflated
You might say
Hahaha you fell into my trap
You see
The opportunity cost of replying with a bad joke would be too costly
Ergo
I DIDNT
I love it it’s my word of the day
That’s a lie
My word of the day was exegesis
Honestly I laughed a little
I mean it was at you not with you
But I did laugh so that’s a win I guess
Yes please also are you ok
If I call you a nerd for knowing that will you be sad
Ok that’s fair
That IDIOT
Noo I hate this guy already
Ok I take it back
Wait so we don’t hate him
Aww I want to hug him and tell him not to become emo like his doppelgänger
Whoa so chess players do have game
Not as much as you chrizz
I knoww
Fine I take it back
You can be chnorizzwhatsoever
But honestly I get the chess rizz hype
Why do you think I started liking marcus
#CHronicallyRizzlessIS
shut up
Don’t lie you laughed a little
Your mom sounds cool
Whose does
Mr stick figure Hanyu
Ohh
Yeah fr though
NONO DONT BE SORRY i was about to go off on a rant about how i started liking him cause of the chess
Cool thoufh
Mayhaps
Aww ty
It’s cause he taught me how to play
And like
He was just really cute about it
But now he’s back to being an arrogant ass bucket (he’s actually rlly nice just let me have this pls)
I wouldn’t know
He made me figure out how to not make my king die
If that makes sense
He’s a nice guy
NO I believe in you
Also why are you surprised
That’s actually kind of cool
ISSOK I UNDERATAND
same with me
Like he can be really sweet
Haha very funny this is my face right now 😐
Wait I’ve got to go quickly cause I’m choosing what to wear for sports awards and I’ve gtg show my brother so he can trash my outfit
Gimme like 5mins
Ugh I realise that was a little longer than 5 minutes
alright if you’re still here I may need you to vote because no one in my family will agree on anything
Christopher
Do you think for one minute with that tiny brain of yours
That I have had enough sleep
To process this
Yeah I saw that
Read it as pen at first so was a little condised
*confised
:((
Also vote pls
Ignore the poses these are screenshots from a video so no judgement aight
Which one to wear
Everyone’s voting different things
I’m gonna show up in my school uniform at this point I swear I hate picking these things it’s fucking boring
Ok
No you have to vote
No not bad things
Good things
Like which is the best
I don’t care which ones are ugly
I’m gonna take that as a compliment
So thank you
Wait so that’s a good thing
Oki thank you
Haha pretty awful it was really boring
I mean it was alright
Won 0 whole awards 💪💪
LETS GO WE LOVE STICK HANYUU
GIVE MW DETAILS PLS IM INVESTED NOW
NO THE BASTARDS HOW COULD THEY
LES BATARDES
🥖🥖🥖😡😡
AHH NOT THE ROOK WHATS WRONF WITH HIM
ISNT THE ROOK ONE OF THE BETTWR ONES AS WELL
LIKW ITS ABOVE THE PAWNS ♟️OH MY GOLLY GOSH THERES AN EMOJI
No like I mean it unironically too sorry if it came off otherwise 😭😭
Why thoufh?
I thofubt he’s really good
Of course the emoji is so cool
I’m not being sarcastic right now I’m serious
There’s only the one :((
Stick Hanyu does it again 💪💪
Honestly good for him I’m weirdly proud of this guy
And I don’t even know him
Or understand chess
Hahaha this is so cool it’s like a chess edit I love it
Wait that’s kind of sad actually
How do chess tournaments work though
Is it by rankings as well?
Because ppl are always talking about rankings and idk what they mean
Ahh ok so are points like based on individual matches then?
OHH
That makes sense then
So it’s based on if you kill the other players stuff?
Idk I feel like it comes up a lot
How do you get ranked, is it on how many matches you win?
Okk
Chess is so confusing to me I don’t understand it
Thanks not confused anymore got it 👍
What on earth is that though
Wait I’ll google I feel like it’s interesting
Ohh that’s kind of smart
My autocorrect does that a bunch too it’s so random
This makes my brain want to throw up but in a good way
HAHAHA so iconic
Wait the history textbook had something I’ll find it
They’re failures Chris you’ve got to understand
RIGHT ITS SO RANDOM
Noo im scared
This is why I take history
But this is actually too funny like the guy lecturing them
Wow the Geo textbook is like a whole comic
That’s actually really cool
Hehehe
I don’t know what shape that is but I love it
No but it’s actually so difficult to process sometimes
Also Chris sorry this is really random
But like
When do you know if you like like someone or if you’re just really good friends
Cause I’m confused with this one person
Noo pls
I’ll take whatever advice you have
Ok wait I’ll give you context if that helps
Cause so you know how I’m not like straight straight ahaha bit of an understatement but whatevs so I really really really thought Iiked this girl last year but I found out she liked someone else and I was like ok whatever got over it so I thought maybe I didn’t really like her that way but idk I’ve been hanging out with her a lot and I honestly can’t tell anymore
And I honestly don’t know like when Olivier asked me if I was gay in econs I panicked cause idk what to say like I like guys but idk if I like girls too and I don’t know if I’m bi or straight or whatever
True true
Yeah
It’s just like every time we hang out I’m like ASKFIS we’d be so cute if we were dating and she’s so pretty and every time she asks me for help with stuff it makes me feel really good and idk I kind of get a little jealous if she’s like joking around with other ppl like ohh are we about to kiss rn and stuff but on the other hand idk if I just really like her as a friend
Noo but that’s the thing I can’t tell because it’s usually really straightforward for me if it’s with guys but I can’t anymore like it’s so confusing
Cause I love hanging out with her as friends and doing friend activities like gossiping and maths past papers and shit
You know??
Ok yeah I get what you mean
Idk maybe?? Cause like I’m out to my parents and my brother and like my close friends but I don’t know if maybe Im just not really used to the idea if that makes sense
Okk that’s actually really helpful
I mean either way I don’t really think she likes me back haha
But thanks anyways :))
Idk I’m pretty sure she isn’t straight but like besides a few times last year when she made jokes and stuff where I was like ohh is she being serious I think that’s just her humour
Like ok a while back she posted a butt ugly pic of me on her story and I replied ‘smash’ and she replied ‘me too ngl’ but that’s just her humour i think
Idk it was the ngl that threw me off
But I think she was joking anyways
Sorry sorry I really don’t mean to dump all this on you
Noo it’s just jokes like that and stuff and I felt like we had a moment when we went for paintball but again I kinda feel like we didn’t
Ugh idk how to describe it
It’s just I can’t tell anymore
Like she sent me a bunch of videos on what she’s reading after completely unprompted and I’m like girl?? Do you want me to fall in love with you??
And it was so cute
I’m not in love with her btw
I was kidding
Just to clarify
In case you didn’t get it was a joke
IM NOT IN LOVE WITH HER
IT WAS A JOKE
THIS IS THE CLARIFICATION
JUST THE IN LOVE WORH HER PART
THE REST IS NOT A JOKE
I WOULSNT DO THAT
Yeahhh
Sorry for any confusion
Anything you want to vent I’m here for a while?
Noo I wouldn’t that would be really insensitive
Noo wtf
That’s so meann
Ok that’s just creepy
Aww I’m sorry that actually sucks
If it helps my first crush was this guy in kindergarten because he was ginger and I just thought it was cool because I wanted to be ginger
So I thought it would like spread to me if he was my boyfriend
Unfortunately, they were quite childish though as you can see
WHAT DID YOU THINK
I honestly have no idea if that’s an insult or a compliment
No it’s actually quite bad this is why shit doesn’t work out
Wait lemme google
Niice just like me fr
Aww that’s sweet
Alrighty then you too 🫡
Haha bye
Okok wait so you can’t tell anymore ok
I mean ik you won’t
But if she found out I would die
Like physically disintegrate ok
I don’t know what that is
CHRIS I need to sleep by 11 I’m swimming tmrw so PLEASE come back
Also pls pls pls can you vent to me about something like no pressure if you’re not comfortable but I feel like I vent to you constantly and I don’t want you to feel like this friendship is one sided cause you never get to say anything if yk what I mean
Tyy 🥹🥹🥹
Umm ok
Np I don’t mind if you do tbh
Like I’m sure you won’t say anything
And like I trust you :))
Aww thanks Chris that’s really nice of you to say
I mena you really don’t have to I just don’t want you to feel like I never shut up ahaha you can not shut up too and I’ll be fine
Oki thank youuu
See you :)
Aww it’s ok it’s just exam season
At least that’s what I’m telling myself
The other day I was a little annoyed at my brother cause he kept asking me to help him with stuff when I had work and I thought I was hiding it well but his girlfriend told me I looked really stressed ahaha
It’s cool that she noticed though that’s really nice of her
Yeahh sounds kinda awkward
That and your lack of apostrophes 😔
Oh my bad my bad
ASJDJSIS this grammar things really tough
YES it was on purpose
I would NEVER do that by accident I simply refuse
NO YOUR INFLUENCE IS FINITE
Wait I’ve got a question about solubility rules
You know for the pms and castro bear thing
Are they soluble in everything aside from sulfates and g7 for pms and just sulphate for ca st ba
Idk if that makes sense but I’m so confused
Because otherwise calcium hydroxide would be insoluble
Anytime 👍
Ok I’m gonna go ask Howard
But thanks anyways!
Ohh no I haven’t actually cant be bothered
Nah you’re better
I’d rather not scroll through results too much effort
Idk it’s just so annoying
To google individual things like is calcium soluble, lead solubility, etc
WHAT IS IT
I MUST KNOW
NOO ITS CREEPY
WHAT IS THAT MONSTROSITY
Can I please be mean to him about it
I’ve studied for a whole hour I need a reward 🥺
Thank youuu
Gonna send it to him and ask him what on earth he’s on
Wow
Don’t even know what to say to that
Send proof
I don’t believe you
So proud 🥹
If this is a video game where you run outside I’m gonna be mad
Fine fine
I have to go do more chem now :(
🫡
Wait can I send you what I got not sure if it’s correct
But if you’re not done yet I won’t spoil it for you
Wait why do you need to hung about gravity
*think
NOO I thought I had it
Because I just found the moment and one joule is one nm
So I thought it was just that
But now I have no clue
Is it not just that??
Wait I’ll draw it
Oh true
I hate Howard
Same but still
So rude
I have to do chemistry and now I must do this ADJDJSKS
Haha you’ll get it eventually
whoa looks fun!!
So I’m proud that at least one of us is touching grass
It’s what the library doesn’t have
Birds
Annoying ones
Yeah :(
It’s more like screaming
Yeahh
Like sunset and sunrise
They go crazy I don’t know what our neighbours think
Whoa that looks so nice
That’s crazy thoufh I’ve been in boat houses before but they’re still weird to me
Like once
Singapore
Yeahh it was my brother’s friend’s
But they lived there permanently
And my mom has a friend who lives in one too it’s so cool
Like in a boat house?
What do you mean
Going to see yachts is cool it’s like the ultimate experience
Haha np
It’s so much easier
You should come sometime you’ll see
Bugis library
Just lmk if you’re going and I’ll go too
But in the afternoon it gets really crowded
Afk??
Sorry I’m a little stupid
Ohh gotcha had to google
Still don’t entirely know what you mean
But yes I think so
Ohh you’re afk I get it
Omg the most embarrassing thing just happened I told Molly she could charge her stuff where I’m sitting and she came over to get her iPad just as I was doodling the word salt ahaha
It looks so cool thoufh
Affirmative 👍
It’s kind of fun
WHATTT
go away
It could be like a sticker or something
I’m so bored ugh
Nonono can he still win??
Okk that’s good 🤞
Yup
Maybe an hour or so
Until I finish chem
Incredibly
Are you coming to the library now?
Yuhh 💪💪
Yay I understood that I’m so proud of myself
HAHAHAHA
I WIN
YOU LOSE
AND I KNOW HE SAID POTENTIAL ENERGY BUT
I USED THE SAME EQUATION SO IM RIGHT
Okk I see what you mean
But I’m still right
Wait wait I’m back sorry had to clear the table
Ok so I see why you’re right but somehow I feel like my way works better
Just cause
Maybe I’m biased
Wait I’ll get a dumbbell gimme one minute
Fine then it’s 0.5pi * 1/4
Wait doesn’t it just average out
Ok so
I think it’s just 37.5 because it’s the energy needed which is going to be the same no matter how hard it is
If that makes sense
Because it feeling difficult doesn’t make it use more energy in a physics sense
It just means you’re not strong enough
Isn’t it just that you aren’t able to put that much force in?
I’m not 100% sure though
Nono like you’ll always need to put the same energy in
It feeling difficult is your body not being able to put the energy in
Doesn’t mean it needs less energy
Because imagine it’s just a piece of wood that is mechanically lifted
Not an arm
Doesn’t that just make it the same force needed
Ok for example
If I need to lift a 5000kg weight I need to apply a force of 50000N which I can’t do
But someone else
Who’s ridiculously strong might be able to
But we both have to use the same force
And so if you use the equation it ends up being the same
Wait what do you mean
Yay my favourite
Yeah
But the force we need to exert is the same
Nono i get what you mean
I’m so confused now
👍
WHOA that’s awesome
That’s so cool I’m going to have to read this article
Ok so I have to go to sleep now unfortunately but tomorrow morning I’m gonna read the hell out of that article
Should I involve my brother??? He’s also an engineering nerd ahaha
NOO I love it this is so entertaining
Ok so I’m pretty sure that I’m wrong about the moments thing but using mgh makes sense but so does your complicated thingy
ITS SPREADING
I CHABFED IT YOU XANT SEE XSUSE JTS LATER
BUT I DID
I WAS TIRED OKKK
Okk but I still feel like I can make them equal each other because I did the exact same thing as if I had done mgh ugh I don’t even know anymore
No but same and i don’t even know if I’m wrong
Hahaha yeah no worries I believe you
Did he win? I’m scared now
Sorry would have texted more but she was sitting RIGHT NEXT TO ME
But anyways I don’t think I like her that way anymore ahaha
Just get like friend vibes from her if you what I mean not that anything happened it’s just the conversations we have I would NOT have with someone I was crushing on
What do you mean?
Like it’s more of things I wouldn’t talk to my crush about yk??
No more like who we think is rlly attractive shit like that etc etc
More etcs
So not really like crush kinda stuff
Aww that’s cute
And it wasn’t weird or anything yk it was just like gossiping and shit
So it was really just more of friend vibes
Hahaha no definitely not
Just thought I would update you
That my little freak out is over :)
Wait gimme two minutes
Okk like that wasn’t a freak out freak out but I was a little panicked not thaaat much though
But the last few days have been so shitty like freak out freak outs for no fucking reason yk
Just exam stress ig
And not swimming
That gets too me too much energy and I go crazy
Yeahh but I’m feeling ok now so that’s good
Heheh thankss
Shut up
Most accurate thing I’ve ever heard
Also the number of ppl who think I’m naive or innocent is so funny to me
this is scaring me how do you know this about me
Also ace econs?? it’s nice someone has confidence
I like that you’re chill as well like it’s so nice to have genuine conversations
Nono like I do but you’re just nice to talk to
UGH NOOO
GO AWAYY
Aww it’s nice that someone else understands your little nerd things
Kidding kidding your nerd things are fun
Probs will
Or already have
Also I’m so sorry but I’ve got to go now byee
Oh noo
I hope you feel better :((
I know too much coffee makes me anxious
But just relax and have some water or something and it’ll wear off
Thanks Chris that’s really sweet of you to say but unfortunately this was my fault haha
I thought it was the last question for some reason and didn’t flip through to the end
And then I went to sleep because I was so exhausted instead of checking through my paper so it was definitely my fault
No I literally slept so eaely the night before like I missed dinner because I couldn’t stay awake so idk what happened
I talked to my English teacher she was really nice she gave me candy
The comments are so funny
Wow chess people are nerds I didn’t know it was possible to be this nerdy
It’s cute though
CHRIS CHRIS CHRIS DID YOU KNOW HE WON
ARRIYAN TOLD ME WHY HAVENT YOU UPDATED ME YET
AND APPARENTLY IT WAS A REALLY TOUGH MATCH
AKDJWODHAOAJ

But I’ve become a chessmantic
Hehe was about to google

I’m so sorry I really didn’t mean to overstep or anything i just meant he should like talk to you about it
Olivier??
Like as in if he wanted to know he should talk to you I didn’t mean to like imply anything that’s all I said
It’s just cause like he was saying how he thinks I’m pan
And then he was like look how good my gaydar is
I don’t even know
Yeah maybe
But like idk it’s really confusing to me cause I have like no experience with this stuff
Yeahh ik what you mean
Haha yeah that’s what he asked me too
Actually it was worse

Turns out
It’s just his gaydar
No question mark even

Basically they’re all irritating people who’s idea of a fun time is getting drunk and they’re all so fucking boring and vapid and my cousins’ parents are actually the shittiest people ever
But my moms side is alright
This is very summarised btw

Like the bad side of the family

Heyy just wanted to let you know that if you want to send your paragraph privately if in a gc is kinda intimidating that’s ok, no pressure or anything but I’m here if you want
But you totally don’t have to so pls pls pls don’t if you don’t want to
Shut up for a second I’m reading
Yeah tbh they’re honestly so funny but not in a wow you’re really witty way but more of a like wtf way yk??
I just get pissed off if they’re rude to ms Campbell otherwise they can do whatever they want
Like I have issues with tony because of shit like that
Nothing he’s done in my classes but yeah other stuff my friends have told me is fucked up so I just don’t interact with him
But Philip and amartyadon’t really do anything like that so I’m cool with them ig
Yeahh and like Sara was telling me he told this one girl in her class she’s rlly pretty and guys would ask her for handjobs so she should learn and he demonstrated on her water bottle not trying to gossip or anything but I don’t really give a fuck if tony gets offended by this
So yeah
Really dislike him
Yes absolutely go ahead!
Not sure if I will
But I’m happy to talk to anyone about it
It depends on how I do ahaha
Okk
No I don’t
Sure no worries
Do you want me to text him first?
Okk
Yeah ofc I’ll let him text me if he wants to but no pressure at all ahaha
I was extremely confused for a hot second
Christopher Christopher Christopher
You’re probably awake given that your sleep schedule is fucked
I think olivier is a little delusional so sad for him :(( anyways if you could reply to his message that would be awesome
K thabjs Chris
🍖🍖🍖
Chris Chris Chris Chris Chris Chris
It’s so funny how my autocorrect picks up the fifty different ways I spell your name when I’m typing fast
If you’re in school can you come tot eu heritage?
*to the
Ohh I forgot whoopsies
Cause today felt like two separate days idk why it was weird
No
You do, rifht?
Hahahaha true
I accept your apology
It’s a little shitty but admaths seems worse
Thank you you
Six using my dads old phone and the autocorrect is forgetting
*soz
*diffeernt
He’s awesome sauce
Luke who Shi ni de ba ba
*29
*wo
But yes it is Prianka
Luke I am your father
Same as this probably
Wow
Wow
Wikipedia article is kinda interesting though
HAHAHAHA Chris what a knee slapper you’re so funny 😭😭🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😜😜😝😝🤪🤪
Pretty good actually I didn’t understand jack shit in the last question so I just copied from the text but that’s pretty standard for Chinese
🍦🍦🍦
It was actually goood
You?
Wait I’m stupid how was Admaths as well I forgot to ask youu
🥳🥳🥳
Oh noo
Don’t stress too much about it now at least you’ve finished it!
Oh yeah you sent them on the gc
If it helps when I went in for French my desk was covered in eraser shavings so I think everyone was struggling ahaha
Also all my friends said the exam was awful
It was after admaths i think
Saaame I don’t understand why it was so difficult
No like everyone I saw after admaths looked so stressed apparently the exam was really hard idk
Yeahh
Also Nishtha and I ran into the invigilator at holland village 💀💀
The one who’s always wearing a grey shirt and puts his water bottle in the back pocket of his jeans
Yeah I think so
Yeahh
It was so scary I thought they just lived in the exam hall
Oh well weichun usually bothers him so maybe that’s why
Hahaha yeah I’d be pissed too
Oh no
I’m so sorry for you
He broke my Rubik’s cube in grade five and didn’t apologise :(
And I’m still mad about it
To be fair it was really janky and he broke it by accident
I’m still and thoufh
YEAH
Mine was my mom’s old one
But he did somewhat redeem himself though during econs
Because I accidentally took roye’s calculator as well as mine
Weichun
And I realised ij the exam hall
So I called an ivigilator over and explained and asked her to give it back to him
But I didn’t know his last name rifht
So weichun who was already fully turned around in his seat and listening told me
Right I was surprised and a bit confused
But it was quite nice of him
Truee
And I felt so bad csuse i made fun of him for not being able to open his locker and then left (with his calculator) and then came back cause I forgot my pencil case said good luck and didn’t even realise
Ohh no problem
If you need to go that’s cool
Otherwise I’ll still be here
Bye
Nooo they never shut up he makes fun of me constantly and the other one lives pretending he’s going to step onto my hand and then biting me
They’re really fun though
But scary
You’d think they’d peck right cause that’s what birds are meant to do
They bite like full on chew on your finger/ears/hair and it’s really painful
Also rude 😡😡
But they’re really awesome honestly I’ve had cats and a dog and birds are more interesting
Wait that’s so cool
Do you have pictures?
🫡🫡
Oh no that sounds awful I’m sorry
Ohh ok that’s cool
Chris I’m so fucking done with this textbook it skips from 1905 to 1917
It goes past a whole WAR to talk about “Rasputin: Sex Maniac or Holy Man?”
So now I know what his pale, piercing, flax-blue eyes look like but I don’t know the fucking economic effects of wwi on Russia
HES NOT EVEN THAT RELEVANT IN MY OPINION THE FIRST WORLD WAR WAS A LITTLE MORE IMPORTANT BUT MAYBE IM JUST WRONG
True the man just had it all I guess
He’s a party kind of guy
Nooo
Well yes
It’s the tsar and his wife they’re besties with him
Well he and the tsarina were like besties with benefits according to the rumours
Maybe she thought his holiness would rub off somehow
Don’t worry that was fully intended
I’m so done with history
I’ve been listening to a one hour loop of Rasputin to motivate myself
Next Thursday
LOVER OF THE RUSSIAN QUEEN
thanksss
OH NO I FORGOTTY
GOOD LUCK CHRISSS
YOURE GONNA DO SO AWESOME
THEYTE GONNA BE SCARED BY YOUR AWESOMENESS
Hey, how was admaths?
Were they scared by your awesomeness??
Noo that sucks
Yeah
You are too right?
I am actually terrified
Heyy, are you doing ok?
Oki
Yeahh just wanted to check up on you though cause it’s still awful even if you didn’t know her well
Yeah
I know, it must be horrible
Especially for her friends who were with her
Yeah ok
I’ve got to go though cause I have swimming
Ok it’s just like sports romances where the guy is like all sweaty from said sports and maybe like a little beaten up like nothing too too bad just maybe like a scraped knee or a bloody lip or smth that’s awesome sauce like idk why that’s exactly my type sorry this is a little embarrassing
Yeahh
Ok you might maybe judge me for this but like we were in pe with another class and this guy I won’t say who joined in with our group for funsies but like his knee was kinda bleeding a little and he was really sweaty and that was kinda very attractive hahaha
THANK YOU none of my friends get it
Csuse they’re all like eww sweat
Yes please
Is that a book or like the combo in general
Ok gotcha
Whoa
Sure I’ll try it
Send me a link or smth
Thanks
Is it good though?
Or just weird
Csuse like that’s my issue with a bunch of stuff rifht like with anything published on idk watt pad or anything I can’t get past the grammatical errors
Okk
Ohh cool that’s good
I mena not really but its ok nothing weirder than some of the shit I’ve read
Depends
I’m not gonna say the weirdest shit I’ve read cause my mom for some reason does not believe in censoring books
She probably should
Well that explains a lot
Kidding you’re the coolest
Nono it’s not but you’re alright
Ok so there’s like educational/just creative weird and like entertaining weird
Ok phrased it badly
More like stuff that’s just innovative but still weird
Like Melissa broder’s books
The Pisces was pretty wacky
It’s not the weirder of the two I’ve read but I liked it better
So basically
This woman Lucy rifht
She’s a little obsessed with her ex
Very depressed
Very stalkers
*stalkery
Etc etc
And so when she blacks out cause she’s on drugs with a bunch of donuts in her car
She gets pulled over by the police they call her sister
She moves in with her sister to dogsit when she’s on holiday
And so basically she’s going to group therapy
But she thinks everyone’s a bitch
And she ends up hooking up with random guys but it’s graphic in like a gross way
And she’s pissed csuse it was such a shit experience
And she meets this guy
He’s a swimmer
But she only ever sees him when he’s half in the water
Ones ex
Hahaha sorry my mom came in to tell me to go to bed
That was meant to say one sec
Ok so anyways
She keeps talking to him
He’s awesome  sauce (as swimmers are)
And they yk do some stuff if you catch my drift
But he never gets out of the water
Like she’s not in the water
Ok anyways moving on
So she’s like wow hashtag dream guy
Nono he just gives her head
Anyways
Hahaha that would be hilarious
Anyways
He’s like can I trust you
And she’s like yeah dude I’m not gonna judge like look at me
So turns out he’s a merman rifht
And it’s pretty weird like the sex is graphic but again not in a great way
And she’s like a little gay but repressed
Yeah basically amongst other stuff
Do you want me to explain
Cause I will
Basically
His tail like doesn’t start until like below his butt
Which is kinda weird
But whatevs
Like can’t be very aerodynamic
But anyways
It’s actually hilarious
I’ll find it for you but like tomorrow ok cause I’ve got to re-download
Ok so they’re having sex and she’s like I’ll bring you to my house to have more sex so she gets a wagon and brings him
Problem is
The dog hates him
Oh subplot forgot
The dog is awesome he loves her unconditionally sorry forgot to mention that’s kinda important
Spoiler alert he dies at the end
And so
The dog is the sweetest ok we love him
And she has to drug the dog so she can have sex with the merman
And basically idk how to describe this without going into detail but when they have sex it’s honestly like she’s having sex with a girl so that’s why she’s like a little repressed
Anyways
So this goes on rifht
And he finds out she was gonna leave him at the end of summer csuse she’s only staying with her sister when she’s on holiday
Oh cool
And he gets pissed
Goes back to the sea
Except he can’t walk so it’s quite embarrassing for him
Csuse he has to like flop back
And so she feels pretty awful
No it’s quite sad actually
Like he’s a representation of her basically
And so she sleeps on a rock a bunch and she’s very depressed csuse he left
But then one night he comes out
And he’s like come with me underwater
And she’s like yes pls
And she’s like gimme until Thursday cause I’ve got to take care of some stuff
She goes back
Finds out the dog died cause he overdosed on drugs so she could sleep with an imaginary fish
She’s been depressed
Goes back to him on Thursday
And basically he wants her to drown herself
And she’s like coolio
BUT
She realises
She’s not the only one
She’s like the 18th
So she’s like uh uh no siree
And she goes back to the house
Oh and she slept with some random cab driver at some part soz forgot to mention
But without protection
And the book ends hinting she’s pregnant
But you don’t know who’s the father
Csuse the merman is imaginary
So yeah
HAHAH
Anyways sorry for spamming
It wasn’t like smut though that’s the thing
Haha ok I’m glad
Like it was just sad I almost cried at the same end when the dog died
The pisces
It’s so good
Also by the author is milk fed but the sex just grossed me out in that one and I felt like there was no point but ik some people really liked it
It’s mainly about this girls eating disorder
Omg Chris I’m so sorry I didn’t get to listen to your weird books but I have to go cause I have swimming tomorrow 😭😭
I promise I’ll listen to yours whenever
Or like
Just text me
And I’ll read it
🫡
Chris I’m back what happens next I must know
Are you at school yet
Christopher
Stop ignoring me
Whoa
I think you win
But it sounds really interesting honestly
Like I’ve never really been into manga but it sounds super cool
Also
HIRRY UP AND FINISH IT
so I can find out what happens next
Oh yeahh are you done with exams after tomorrow?
I’m actually so stressed though
Like I can’t wait for this week to me over
Hahaha no it’s ok
It’s not even exams at this point
It’s like all the other stuff like formal and PowerPoint night (im doing it with some of my friends) and there’s a swim beach thing
And like I don’t mean to whine I know it’s really awesome
It’s just a lot in one week
Yeah we all make PowerPoints and present then
*them
Im doing what everyone would look like with there face merges with harry potters
I wanted to do gollum but it didn’t merge properly
Hahaha I started hanging out with them recently and they’re all so nice I’m so glad I’m sitting with them now
Nandos is really cool though
Right
Okk np
Pretty good actually
How about you?
Yeah I didn’t really want to think about it and stress once I’ve finished
NOOO NOT YOUR HAIR
Ohhh ok wait lemme go read
Actually I can’t be bothered
Like the chat
Im struggling to be empathetic and not make fun of you for this just pointing that out ok
But yeah that sounds annoying
There were a few questions that people got different answers to me though on
You’re just giving wise old granddad with dementia vibes yk
Of course hahaha
Omg Marcus came up to me today and it’s not even a big deal but we were talking about econs so I hope we’re becoming friends again
👴👴👴
Haha it was really funny cause he apparently called my name several times but I was listening to lamb of god so I didn’t hear him and I got really scared cause he suddenly cycled right up behind me 💀💀
I KNOW IT MADE ME SO HAPPY CAUSE WE USED TO BE SUCH GOOD FRIENDS
thank you
I asked him out
And after that we kinda stopped talking at all
Which is sad
But anyways irrelevant
DO YOU LIKE LAMB OF GOD
Ohhh ok
One sec
Listening to my brother play this when I was about five probably did things to my brain function
But that’s ok it’s not like you can hear the lyrics it’s a lot of screaming so very hard to understand
Yuhhh
That’s so cool omg
What do you usually listen to
No probs
I love jazz for studying
No way same
For me it was csuse of my brother
HAHAHA same I’ve been listening to tool a bunch recently
I usually don’t listen to a ton but I’ve been listening to more the last few days
Anytime
PLEASE
YES PROBABLY
wait lemme see if I can find some of my brother
On my moms insta 💀💀
Ok this is probably wrong and I haven’t listened in a while
But it kinda reminds me of the tornado of souls solo
But it’s kinda different i think
I don’t think it is though
Megadeth
It’s really good
What’s he playing?
Ohh hahaha
It’s not tornado of souls I don’t think
He’s so good though wtf
Yeah go for it
Wait that’s actually ridiculously impressive
Noo that must really suck
Wow that must be quite stressful
Like the thing for me is that my grandad is probably like that but he was quite awful with my mom when she just married my dad and so she will absolutely not take anything from him yk
The rest of my family is awful though
Like extended
My cousins are actually in such a bad place right now because of it
Yeah it’s probably tough especially if it’s coming from your parents
🫡
Yayy
No way I’m going to sleep
But have fun
Bye
Took it on a disposable camera so I’ll send it once it gets developed!
I’m not sure actually I have to take it to some place but probably
Some of the photos are going to be so shit though
Csuse they’re like blurry and stuff
Yeah it’s really cool
Like you have to go to a shop and get your pics developed
Probably but I don’t have the equipment
School or public?
Ohh
Not sure but maybe email the librarian?
I’m sure they’d be happy for free books
No problem
You have to chug it
Like a litre at a time
This is the way
Just drink it anyways
Oops
My bad haha
Oh so sad
But I hear they have something for that?
Like not sure if you’ve heard of it but it’s basically frozen water
And you put it in your drink
And BOOM
Cold
It’s super cool very modern
Get it
Cause it’s cold
But also cool
AHHHHHHHHHHH
ALSO Chris pls pls pls play go with me I promise it’ll be fun ok I’m just sick of the computer beating me on level 0 and if I play against a real person I have someone to direct my anger at
So yes or no on the go
I’m packing for tmrw at the same time though and I’m really awful just a warning
No worries
Awesome
Idk
Can you send me a link
I’m looking for one now
Ok one sec
Ok my username is kat1234
I have no clue how to make a game
Tu
*ty
9x9?
Maybe just make it this
Im a bit impulsive anyways with these things  so Im not gonna take that long
I was gonna say
I thoufht you had some plan and I got so scared
You will not
I don’t even fully understand the scoring
I vaguely get it
Wait I have no idea what you did wrong
Shit
Lemme thibj
Or maybe you’re lying to me
AHHH I don’t know anymore
Wait can you tell me what you did wrong after I move
For educational purposes pls
It’s a valid fear
Thank you I didn’t pick it but I love it
It looks like modern Darth Vader
And anakin is awesome (until he does all that random shit) so that’s cool
YESS
I’m proud of you Chris
Nah you’re good dw
I’m probs missing stuff but whatever
No Chris I mean the other type of suit
It’s very aerodynamic
Great for the water
Of course not
Also my goggles are like barely holding together
So hopefully I can get new ones before tomorrow hehe
Both apply
Also
So I don’t like her anymore I promise BUT Sara mifht come watch tomorrow and I really hope she can make it 🤞
20000% don’t worry Chris
Nope it’s cool I’m just gonna gaslight myself and it’ll all be fine don’t worry
Not that there’s anything to gaslight
But if there were gas

YUHHH

Np bye
Ok that one was funny
That is true
I genuinely think this might be the best joke you’ve made in a while
You have to drink it at exactly midnight but you have to do it in a dark alleyway and spin three times anti clockwise and then say the magic phrase
Also I fucked up my 200 br :))(

Oh like I was sobbing in the bathroom for a while and I cried in like 2 cabs on the way over but I had a valid reason ok I just don’t want my coach to think that I’m annoying yk
WHOA

HUH
No please don’t it’s ok
Hahahaha thank you but my mom did say it’s weird how I usually bounce back so quickly after doing badly and don’t like process it so I guess I’m making progress by crying
I’m probs just pmsing to be fair
But thanks
Like when you’re on your period idk I’m not rn but certain times of the month I will cry at everything it sucks
Like it really depends normally I’m fine
Haha yeah it’s weird cause I can tell when I’m gonna get my period if I have like 50 breakdowns the week before and have bad acne
Ahh it’s ok I’ll be fine but thank you
I mean some ppl have it a lot worse thoufh so I’m alright I just get bad mood swings

Ugh whatever I was clearly exhausted and delusional
I don’t associate with April me
Terrifying
That’s gonna show up in my nightmares
Also I was kinda upset when I got home but my bird was really sweet he let me hug him a little even though he hates being hugged and he tried to regurgitate food to me (it was really gross but honestly the sweetest thing ever)
Just thought it was kinda funny haha
See he cares
SEE it’s so good
I love it
Which part are you at

Oh I thought you meant like a specific pry
*prt
*part
Yesss i love when ppl like the books I’ve recommended hehe
Yeah
It was alright completely swam into the wall cause I have no depth perception but only added 3 seconds
Which is good considering I basically haven’t swam for ages
Hahaha fair enough
Yeah I was gonna ask why you were being nice
Like I thought you were gonna say you wanted to watch me swim and I was waiting for you to insult me
Oops gtg
You little shit
I’m actually a little scared they will but oh well
I am joe’s complète lack of surprise
Why the fuck is it French again
I KNOW RIFHT ITS SO COOL
Like now I know how to diy bombs
YEA
DID YOU FINISH IT
BUT BASICALLY THAT SUMS IT UP
I’ve never read animal farm thoufh should I?
I’ve read 1984 and that was pretty good so maybe I’ll add it to my list
ITS SO GOOD RIFHT
I knowww i binged it and then watched the movie the next day
Oh cool I’ll read it then
Also if you’re going to read any books by the same author choke was pretty good I just finished it
It’s a little fucked up
But that makes it better
Beautiful you is super mega ultra extra fucked up and I wanted to cry and die after it
Yeah hahahaha that’s on the cover
It’s about a sexaholic and it’s quite graphic thoufh but worth it
I can lend it to you if you want
Oh wait you’re not in sg
It’s actually frightening how obsessed I am with this book now
Like the twist was done so well
Fight club
I’ll be honest it really hyped up HL chem for me
And computers
Hehehe of course
It’s ok I didn’t even notice
Both look wrong now though
Also if you watch the movie it gets bonus points cause brad Pitt is hot
And so is Helena bonham carter
So like
Double bonus points
I’m imagining a whole range here
From like fight club
To allergies
YEAH the afterword was so good I usually hate them!!
and the important part was the rules
To have a sort of chorus
That comes up in his other books too
Hahaha I just found that interesting and rlly cool
Tbh I didn’t remember the bit about the allergy support group
Yeah
EWWW get that disgusting emoji out of my face
Sorry for your allergies though
That sucks
AHHHGG
No it’s like 12 why
What time is it there?
Pls
Hahahaha thats so confusing what
I’d be all over the place
Chris when you get back to sg you and I need to have a face to face talk about fight club ok
But bye have fun
L bozo (hope u deel bwtter)
*feel
*better
Sure you don’t
Is that meant to happen??
Hey
Why’d you delete
Yes pls
I’m curious now
Hahahaha thats so cute
You’re concentrating so he’d in the first pic
*in the
Wait no
So hard
That’s what I meant
My bad
Its tough living with my autocorredt ok
No it corrects the wrong things sometime
One day I’m gonna send you a screen recording of me typing so you know what I go through
One day I’m gonna send you a screen recording of me typing so you know what I go through
*go
Ok that wasn’t even that bad
Go for it send me any nice ones
I so now
*do not
Ok maybe a little that wasn’t even on purpose
But to be fair
I dropped my wallet
It’s benefiting from me
It’s a symbiotic relationship
Idk it fell
Aw that’s nice I thought you were gonna say none of them were
Csuse yes I am staring at the table in one
But my nose looks nice
Mrt why
NO I THOUFHT YOU WERE GOING TO
Hahaha what Chris I do go out occasionally
To be fair i had to
But still
yea
No probs
Pretty good I was lame 5 which is awesome
One of the fastest lanes
So I was like yea I got this
It was pretty fun
I mena to be fair I was racing 12 year olds but still
Nice little ego boost
Thank you
Oh wait you can’t hear any of that
Oh nvm you kinda
 Can
She also called me short
Hahaha
She’s really nice though even though she said I was short
It’s cause her whole family is crazy tall
I think she’s the same height as me
YEAH
IF IT HELPS
IVE BEEN TALLWR THAN MY MOM SINXE THE FOURTH GRADE
OK BUT IF YOURE RELATED THATS WORSE
YOU COULD HAVE BEEN TALLER
BUT YOU WERENT
Hahaha you’re gonna start shrinking soon
Too bad it’s in your genes 🧬
No I don’t think so
Ok well basically
Idk I just feel like I look better smiling without my teeth idk
It’s just like a habit I guess?
Also it’s kinda weird for me to smile with my teeth for photos cause I hate holding it yk?
Like it feels fake unless I’m like laughing or smth
Idk for me I’m a bit self conscious sometimes but it really depends
Like on the situation cause if I’m smiling with my teeth for a photo on purpose it feels fake and I feel like I look rlly weird but if it’s candid it’s ok I guess
I just prefer the way I look smiling without my teeth
Ok cause for me I do smile without my teeth normally sometimes but naturally I smile with my teeth too but posing for photos it’s always the former idk if that makes sense
Your smile is really nice though!!
Oh cool no worries
I mean up to you
Get it if you want to though

Rosetta Stoned

Did you manage to listen to Rosetta stoned?
I’m gonna go shower real quick I might finish before you’re done listening csuse it’s like ten mins long 😂
Yesss what is it
Ooh it’s catchy
Teen town
But if it’s got birds I’ve got to listen
Chris you’re not gonna believe this
As soon as I started bird land
It summoned the bird
He flew into my room so he approves
YEAHH
cool
Teen town sounds like the kind of bops they play in Pokémon when you’re fighting the gym leaders and I mean that in the best way possible
Wow that’s fun sight reading sounds tough
I sent him away I don’t like when he sits on my bed I’m scared he’ll poop on it
Lemme find him again
It’s so good rifht
I use it to study to sometimes
But only if I’m super focused
Otherwise I’ve got to listen to like one hour loops of mother mother
Or Rory Gilmore study playlists
They’re fun too
I like verbatim and arms tonite
Burning pile is also cool
Wait lemme find it
YES THIS IS THE PART
THIS IS THE WEIRD PART
ITS SO FUNKY
He keeps imitating me sneezing I’m so done with him
The annoying kind??
African greys
The other ones a conure
Hang on I’ll find kili for you
This is ozai like from avatar
He’s just chilling on top of the fridge
Haha
Get it
Yeah so kili is normally in the kitchen and we have like a back room that’s set up for them and ozai is in the hall
So we put them in their cages at night and ozai has a hall cage for when we’re eating or if we have to go out
And at night they go into their cages in here
Csuse kili has the kitchen area which is like safe for him if ozai is in the hall when no one is home we’re scared he’ll bite a wire or smth dangerous
It would be the other way but ozai would wreck the dishwasher/ washing machine / dryer
And he likes the hall he sits on the chairs and couches a lot
Yea pretty much
Also he’s bigger so he’s waaay more destructive
They’re both assholes but they’re so entertaining
Ok so like ozai was rlly shy when we first got him and we thought he was quiet turns out he’s crazy and needed to get comfortable first
And kili is equally evil like he’ll bite and stuff but he’s more cuddly
If he’s in a good mood yes
Not ozai he’ll Jill you
*kill
Rn he’s trying to rip the seams out of the couch my dad hates it
Kili’s just sitting on me and preening himself
Nah he’s cool dw
He’s quite chatty
Likes the sound of his own voice too much
Not a single one
Omg I’m at my aunt’s house in India
And she has this adorable dog
I KNOWWW
me toooo they’re the best
I love when ppl have pets that I can hang out with
Awww
It’s more fun to hang out with other people’s thoufh no responsibilities
I used to have a dog rifht
And every time ppl would come over
She would go to them instead of us
Idk it’s just a dog thing cause so many ppl complain about this
You can hang out with my birds if you want but they’re annoying and will bite you
Ok see you!
Whoa that’s so cool!
Wait that’s actually awesome
Was there anything else with it?
HAHAHA Chris what is this
There’s so much going on in it I can’t even begin to unpack it
I love how you’re not even holding a book, you ARE a book
I’m hanging out with my niece and nephew and they’re a little crazy
We had to have a dance party to the my little pony soundtrack
its pretty fun
oh fuck
I closed the tab by accident
Can you resend the link?
It’s cause my mom’s sister is 15 years older than her
So my cousin is 40
So my niece is 4 almost 5 and my nephew is almost 2
He keeps giving me things and idk what to do with them
Like he gave me 6 glasses
And then the car keys
And my niece is making me play Lego with her now (so I search for the pieces, read the instructions to her, and remove whatever she does wrong, you know all the fun parts)
Yea ofc sorry I didn’t reply sooner I’ve been swamped and I’ve only just landed in sg
COOL
A little less than a week
Like we left last Sunday

But I’m still super nervous
Spectronik
They make hydrogen fuel cells, it’s where my brother works
And it’s so cool omg
It’s also paid so fingers crossed I get it
No, who’s that?
